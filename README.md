# ARITHMETIC OPERATION IN PYTHON

 ##### video demo:<https://youtu.be/xNTDtnBcwNM> 
 Description:open your pc or laptop ,then go to pycharm create a new file for the project and click file and press NEW PROJECT then enter file location and click create.it create a default main python file 
 type def main 
 main function code goes here
 (def means -it is used to define a function) 
 pass means -The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.
 return the variable x and y 
 return means -What does return () do in Python?
return() in Python

The return() statement, like in other programming languages ends the function call and returns the result to the caller. It is a key component in any function or method in a code which includes the return keyword and the value that is to be returned after that.
do it for all function like subtract ,multiple ,divide,power,square_root and at last we create bmical 
bmical having a formula to execute 
(bmi=round(y / (x*x), 1))
rount means -The round() function returns a floating point number that is a rounded version of the specified number, with the specified number of decimals. The default number of decimals is 0, meaning that the function will return the nearest integer.
save the file using ctrl+s

then click file select NEW-pythgon file -set the name of the file 
import py test 
freo the main .py import all functions are add ,subtract,multiple,dived,power,square_root and bmical
we should check each function as well as one by one 
assert-The assert keyword is used when debugging code. The assert keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError.
at last we use if condition like 
if __name__ == "__main__":
pytest.main()
if statement is a conditional statement in python, that is used to determine whether a block of code will be executed or not. Meaning if the program finds the condition defined in the if statement to be true, it will go ahead and execute the code block inside the if statement
